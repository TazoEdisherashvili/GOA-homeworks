    <p>The cane corso (pronounced "KAH-Nay KOR-So") is a large and muscular working dog with a noble, confident disposition and a lineage that goes back to ancient Rome. Cani corsi are powerful dogs with a fearless, vigilant nature.

        Because of their size and need for training and enrichment, they're not right for everyone. However, these gentle giants are often misunderstood and can actually make excellent companions. For those who like the idea of a very large dog who is protective and athletic, the cane corso is one to consider.
