        <p>This sandwich recipe reminds me of the seventies. I went through a phase in the seventies when
             I’d order club sandwiches any time my family and I went out to dinner at the club 
             (club. Get it?) and here’s how it would go:

“I’ll have a club sandwich, please, and a Shirley Temple.”

Then I’d eat all the dinner rolls in the roll basket and my dad would say, “How can you eat so much bread?” I 
wouldn’t answer him.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ten or 15 minutes later, my club sandwich would arrive. I would pick apart all the layers, eat the ham, then push 
the plate away and say, “Whew! I’m full!” Then I’d eat all the crackers in the cracker basket and my mom and dad 
would shake their heads and wonder what would one day become of me. Because I love to reminisce, I made myself a 
club sandwich the other night. Here’s how you can make one, too!
<br>
What makes a club sandwich?
<br>
What differentiates club sandwiches from other types of sandwiches is that they contain a third piece of bread, are 
stacked high, and are cut into quarters. 
<br>
<br>
Usually club sandwiches start with three pieces of toasted bread spread with mayo. Then comes the meats
(usually ham and turkey), sliced cheese, lettuce, crisp bacon, and whatever else you like on yours—avocado, thinly sliced tomato, sliced red onion. I love stirring some prepared pesto into the mayonnaise to make an herby spread for the sandwiches. It packs a punch of flavor!</p>
